🎯 Overview
SentinelID is a revolutionary passwordless authentication system that uses behavioral biometrics to identify users. Instead of relying on passwords that can be stolen, we analyze:

Keystroke Dynamics - How you type (dwell time, flight time, pressure)

Mouse Movement Patterns - Your unique cursor movements

Navigation Behavior - How you interact with the interface

Session Patterns - Real-time anomaly detection

Why SentinelID?
Traditional Auth	SentinelID
❌ Passwords can be hacked	✅ Biometric - can't be stolen
❌ Phishing attacks work	✅ Behavior-based immunity
❌ Single login point	✅ Continuous authentication
❌ Manual 2FA required	✅ Automatic verification
❌ No threat detection	✅ Real-time anomaly alerts
🌟 Key Features
🔐 Continuous Authentication
Monitors user behavior continuously during session

No login needed after initial verification

Automatic logout on anomaly detection
